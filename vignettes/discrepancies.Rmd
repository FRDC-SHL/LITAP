This is a non-exclusive list of known differences between LITAP and 
R. A. (Bob) MacMillan's original LandMapR. 
Some differences reflect differences in the programming techniques, 
some reflect deleberate changes. 

#### Missing variables

Some variables are not included in LITAP if they are not necessary. 
For example, the inverted DEMs originally included Vol2Fl, MM2Fl and PArea, 
but LITAP does not include these values because they aren't calculated specifically 
for the inverted DEM, but are identical to those in the non-inverted DEM.

#### Flat areas (where all cells are the same elevation)

When we have an area with flat cells, LITAP uses a different way of assigning 
the direction of flow than the original program (in order to speed things up). 
This results in small differences in flow directions over flat areas.


#### Rounding error

Sometimes, rounding error on very small numbers can result in quite large 
differences especially when looking at percentages, etc.


#### Compounding differences

Adding changes in flow direction to small differences in rounding error can 
result in larger differences when adding up measures over all cells in a watershed.
These should be considered stochastic differences. However if things look really 
different, contact us and let us know!
